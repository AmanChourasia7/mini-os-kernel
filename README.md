# Mini OS Kernel

**Author:** Aman Chourasia

## ðŸŽ¯ Design Philosophy

This project isnâ€™t just about writing code, itâ€™s about understanding the foundations of how an operating system works from the ground up. My goal with this mini kernel is to experiment, learn, and push the limits of low-level programming. Every line of C and Assembly here is crafted with clarity, minimalism, and control in mind.

Key principles guiding this project:

* **Simplicity:** Keep each component small and understandable.
* **Transparency:** Expose whatâ€™s happening at every stage of the boot and runtime process.
* **Modularity:** Make it easy to swap, upgrade, or extend parts of the kernel without breaking everything.
* **Learning-first:** Prioritize understanding over feature completeness â€” a kernel that teaches is better than a kernel that just runs.

This project is as much a personal exploration as it is a technical challenge â€” a playground to really *feel* what it takes to run a machine from scratch.

## ðŸš€ Build & Run

### Requirements

* Linux build environment
* `gcc` (cross-compiler: i686-elf-gcc recommended)
* `nasm` assembler
* GNU `ld` linker
* `grub` bootloader tools
* `qemu-system-x86_64` for testing

### Commands

```bash
make        # build kernel
make run    # run in QEMU
```

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap

* File system support (FAT12/FAT32)
* System calls
* Process scheduler (multitasking)
* User-space program execution
* Basic networking (future stage)
